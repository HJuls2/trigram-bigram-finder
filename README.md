# trigram-bigram-finder

This is an exercise for the Parallel Computing class.<br><br>

The goal is to count **trigram** and **bigrams** of letters in a list of text sources.<br>

The repository contains two Java version of the exercise: a sequential version and a parallel one.<br>

### Profiling

With a naive approach, I see that, analyzing all the text sources in this repository, <br>
the parallel version leads to a time performance improvement of 40-50% compared to the sequential one.

### Istructions

Pass the .txt source files as arguments (each source separated with a blank space) to run both versions.
